Me and Alex were great.  We collaborated and discussed on different ideas 
regarding the different classes.  We ensured that we were on the same page
in terms of understanding how Huffman Trees work and what methods needed
to be done.  This assignment was certainly one of the hardest assignments
we have ever done in this class but in the end, we say it was worth 
the struggle.
