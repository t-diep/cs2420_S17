Group Analysis:  
	We worked well on this assignment.  Both of us had similar strengths (i.e. implementing excellent
test suites and finishing code implementations for each of the different classes).  I took care most 
of the documents, reports, and drawings while Andrew clarified concepts of the Linked List and the Node.  Although
we had somewhat busy schedules, we were able to efficiently use our time when we got togther to work on
code. 
	
Our group worked/didn't work because.....
	Our group worked because we both communicated with each other very well since we updated each other with
changes made to the code implementations.  We had a plan on what to work on first and we committed to our
plans and strategies.
