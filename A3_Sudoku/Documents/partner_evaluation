Homework 3- Sudoku Solver
My Name: Anthony Diep
Partner: Milad Bazzazi

Hours Worked on Project: 20 hours

Partner Score: # - Parter did equal value of work as I did

Group Analysis:  


	We managed to stay on task for the majority of the time spent together on 
the assignment.  However, there were times that we spent too much time 
solving little bugs on our code that should have been saved for another 
time.  Thus, we were not able to have incremental progress as we liked, 
even if we started looking at the assignment last Sunday.  In addition, 
we may have discussed a little too much about the concept of how to 
implement the Sudoku solver versus having to code them in Eclipse IDE.  
We may have also failed to read the assignment specifications carefully 
because we may have easily clarified our own confusions just by reading 
the assignment instructions and specifications. 
	 

Our group worked/didn't work because.....

	If we were to work again as a partnership on future assignments, perhaps 
we will consider setting ourselves little goals to complete in terms of 
the assignment.  For example, when we start looking over an assignment 
over the weekend, we could aim for completing the constructor of a given
class.  We also need to draw more pictures just so we can easily 
implement code and thus get more done.  We depended too much on the 
TA’s help and the professor’s office hours.  As long as we can pre-plan 
efficiently in terms of what to work on the assignment, then I believe 
we can get a lot more done than the previous assignments.
