Group Analysis:  

	Our partnership was good.  We were able to meet three days to work on the assignment, which were Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
We had a busy week so it was moderately challenging to meet together to work on the assignment.  I guided her through some of the 
concepts talked about in class in that she had trouble comprehending.    
	 
Our group worked/didn't work because.....

	Our group worked because we worked on some of the implementation of the assignment when we were able to get together.  We used Skype
to communicate with each other whenever we cannot meet together in person.  We notified each other of any changes made to the code so
that both of us are on the same page.
