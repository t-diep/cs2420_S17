 * I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have learned how to
 * write this program, such that I could throw it out and restart and finish it
 * in a timely manner. I am not turning in any work that I cannot understand,
 * describe, or recreate. I further acknowledge that I contributed substantially
 * to all code handed in and vouch for it's authenticity.

 * This enum allows us to "tag" sorts with an expected performance
 * and perhaps compute different statistics based on this.
