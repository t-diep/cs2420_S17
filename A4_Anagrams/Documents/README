~We implemented a lot of JUnit Tests for each of the methods

~We also created a helper method, called swap, but we ended up not using it.  The reason
why we left it there in the AnagramUtil class is because I already implemented JUnit
Tests for the swap helper method and I didn't want to delete those days of hard coding
them.  Thus, we will keep them even though the swap method was not used.

~Instead of creating three classes to each represent a Comparator for Integer, String, and Character,
we actually created 3 static fields that represented each Comparator (Integer, String, and Character) at the
top but still inside the AnagramUtil class.  Although this is not the convention not expected in 
the assignment, I thought it be easier to do it this way. Because in the JUnit tests, especially
in the insertion sort tests, we can just call the class name then the name of the Comparator field
we want to use.  In essence, it is like an instance field for a class.
