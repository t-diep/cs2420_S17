Partner Score: # - 5

Group Analysis:  

	I had worked on most of the programming aspect of this assignment.  This was because I started the assignment
on the weekend and forgot to contact Gabbie to collaborate on the assignment.  Even though I failed to give her
an opportunity to implement some code, she was able to construct the analysis document and design document in a
timely manner.  She was also able to proofread any syntax and logical errors.  
	 

Our group worked/didn't work because.....

	Our group worked and didn't work because of how much work I put in without letting my partner know when I chose to
start the assignment.  I put too much work and effort without letting her have an equal amount of contribution in terms of
implementing the code.  The assignment was not even difficult to implement which benefits the both of us.  So, all in all, 
our partnership worked because we completed the assignment a lot earlier than usual, but in terms of communication, it is
a bit off but I take responsibility for starting the assignment at the same time with my partner.
