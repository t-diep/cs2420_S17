Hours Worked on Project: 19 

Partner Score: # 5

Group Analysis:  
	 We were able to get the drawings and JUnits done right when starting the assignment.
We struggled to understand how the BST worked, so we felt like we needed a good understanding
of how the tree worked before working on the implementation
	
Our group worked/didn't work because.....
	 Our group sort of worked because we were willing to get the preliminaries completed.
However, if we had more time to collaborate, then we would get the assignment done on time.
Nonetheless, Gabbie has been a great partner and had the preseverance to keep trying.
