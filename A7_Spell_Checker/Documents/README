2) SUMMARY
	We started the assignment on Sunday evening hoping to get the Node class done 
at a reasonable amount of time.  However, we still were not familiar with the BST at the time.
We communicated pretty well.
	

3) LATE WORK
~We are planning for a resubmission on this assignment.  
~We have the remove() method for BST almost done but we will turn in what we have so far
~Comments are cleaned

EDIT 3-03-17:

~We have the remove method for the BST class completed.  It passed all of our JUnits

4) NOTES TO THE TA
~We have a lot of JUnit Tests implemented.  We tested different nodes and different BST's


5) PLEDGE

	I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have learned how to write
 this program (such that I could throw it out and restart and finish it in a timely
 manner).  I am not turning in any work that I cannot understand, describe, or
 recreate.  Any sources (e.g., web sites) other than the lecture that I used to
 help write the code are cited in my work.  When working with a partner, I have
 contributed an equal share and understand all the submitted work.  Further, I have
 helped write all the code assigned as pair-programming and reviewed all code that
 was written separately.

6) DESIGN DECISIONS
	
	We will start building from the Node class and complete its methods.  We will then move on 
to the BinarySearchTree class since that is the next class up in the hierarchy.  Furthermore,
we also decided to set up our Timing class to deduce the amount of time to work on the project.
	 

7) PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND THEIR SOLUTIONS
	We encountered a lot of NullPointerExceptions and StackOverFlowExceptions because we forget to cover
a couple of base cases.  We also realized we wrote our JUnits incorrectly, so went back and fixed them.
