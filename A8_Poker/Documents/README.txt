(Tony Diep)-This code has loads of test cases the check edge cases of many different kinds of hands for poker. These solidify that our code is working properly. The test cases are helpful to look at if there are any questions about what the code should be doing, but there shouldn’t be any questions due to commenting throughout the program.

-We created a hand util helper static class that determines the certain kind of poker hand that a person has, as well as between two players who the the winner will be, and creates a histogram of hands that are dealt so that we can check the cards hands in comparison to each other.
-2 enum classes for rank and suit so that we can easily call and check if the values of hands are what we want them to be.
- In addition it is also important to note that our implementation of hands the best hand is at 0 and the worst hand is at 13.
