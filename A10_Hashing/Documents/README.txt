1) AUTHOR INFORMATION
Homework 10 - Hashing
My Name: Tony Diep
Partner: JoCee Porter
Date:    April 7, 2017

2) SUMMARY
	We learned how to implement three different hash tables as well as learned
how to apply hash functions to "crack" passwords using dictionary attacking 
and brute force algorithms. We also figured that the Hash Table is essentially
an array built behind the scenes.

3) LATE WORK
We do not plan on turning in this assignment late

4) NOTES TO THE TA
-We put the timing code for both Crack class and Hash Tables in the Main class.
We did not agree with the design decision to create two separate classes for
each of the two parts of the assignment. 

5) PLEDGE

	I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have learned how to write
 this program (such that I could throw it out and restart and finish it in a timely
 manner).  I am not turning in any work that I cannot understand, describe, or
 recreate.  Any sources (e.g., web sites) other than the lecture that I used to
 help write the code are cited in my work.  When working with a partner, I have
 contributed an equal share and understand all the submitted work.  Further, I have
 helped write all the code assigned as pair-programming and reviewed all code that
 was written separately.

6) DESIGN DECISIONS
	We decided to start on the Crack class then focus on getting the Hash Tables
done.  However, we ended up doing a little from both parts of this assignment, 
which to some extend did help
	 

7) PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND THEIR SOLUTIONS
	We had some slight statistical marginal errors as well.  We had to make a couple of
logical error changes to improve the accuracy of our statistics.
